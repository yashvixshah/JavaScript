# Does JavaScript have classes?
Initially no and still no.

# Javascript is a PROTOTYPE-BASED LANGUAGE
Classes are just a syntactic sugar(feature for class based developers) but behind the scene it still uses prototype mechanism

# OOPs

# Object: 
-Collection of properties and methods
-e.g promises, toLowerCase

# Why use OOP?
- To make code cleaner and less messier

# Parts of OOP
-Object literal {}
-Constructor functions:
-Prototypes
-Classes
-Instances (new,this)

# 4 pillars
Abstraction - hide internal details (e.g fetch)
Encapsulation - wrap data together
Inheritance
Polymorphism - many ways
