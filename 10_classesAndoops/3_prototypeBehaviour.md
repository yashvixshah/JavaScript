# JS is prototypal behaviour
It does not give up-if it does not find a particular thing, it goes a level up, acceses parents, grandparents until it finds null

-prototype gives us new, this, prototype inheritance, classes

-everything in js is particularly an object
-so array will have a prototype of object and object will have null
-similarly for string etc
